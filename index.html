      <h3>How to:</h3>
      <p>
        Use your arrow keys or WASD to move around the map.
        When you walk near a landmark, scroll down to see it's name, photo, and description. </br></br>
        If you would like to contribute and add your own landmark, click on the link at the bottom that says "Submit your own photo for this location."
        It will take you to a Google Form that you can fill out and submit.
        When a team member has reviewed your entry and uploaded the data into our database, your entry will show up!
        It may take a while since our team members are busy, so please be patient if you do not see your entry. üôè </br></br>
        Please note that any incomplete or inappropriate submissions will not pass the review check and thus will not be allowed on the map.
        Thank you for using our website and we hope you enjoy your stroll around campus!</br></br>

      <h3>About:</h3>
      <p>
        We are a team of students from the Spring 2025 class for ART 101 at UCSC.
        We thought it would be really cool to make a map of UCSC that people could "walk" around to see all the different amazing spots on campus. </br></br>
        For a person who's never been on campus, such as prospective students, it's a neat way to see a lot of the different sights that UCSC has to offer without having to be there in person.
        For a person who has been on campus, it can be a way for them to share their favorite spots on campus or any pretty photos they've taken that they would like to show the world.
